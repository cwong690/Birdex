    <p style='margin: 20px 10px;text-align:center;'>This app will help classify the taxonomic order of birds.</p>
    <p style='margin: 20px 10px;text-align:center;'>
        The data was pulled from the The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. It is a collection of about 48,000 images
        and more than 400 species of birds observed in North America. Birds are separated by male, female or
        juvenile since they look quite different. Text files are also included that contains image file names
        and their corresponding labels. So why is bird conservation important? Also, they're basically modern
        dinosaurs.<br>
        Birds are difficult to classify due to the wide range of their looks even within birds of the same family. Female and male are often quite
        different in appearance. Male birds tend to have much brighter colors used in courting female birds while female birds have duller colors.
